					<h2>Why Electric?</h2>
					<p>The future of transport is electric. Electrification is already becoming mainstream in the automotive sector. Electric propulsion will reduce the energy usage, maintenance costs and environmental impact of air transit.</p>
					<p>At the same time, it enables a smoother, safer passenger experience.</p>
